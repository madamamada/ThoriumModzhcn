		Line1Yharim: Whispers from on high dance in your ears...
		Line1Tsukiyomi: Whispers from above the stars dance in your ears...
		Line2: Press "Left Shift" to listen closer
	}

	GiantClam: {
		Line1: They are large and very slow creatures, but have quite a hefty amount of strength.
		Line2: They have a very good defense, due to their shells making them resistant to most
		Line3: attacks, but I do not fear them at all because I am quite familiar with how to
		Line4: defeat them.
	}

	SunkenSea: {
		Line1: Even after Calamitias dried up the ocean of Ilmeris, it seems that deep in the
		Line2: depths nature had evolved and thrived, Draedon seemed to have quite an interest
		Line3: into this place.
	}

	Deerclops: {
		Line1: ...of all the creatures that roam the land of Terraria, it is this one that leads
		Line2: to confusion more than any other I've encountered.
		Line3: This thing is clearly no god, and yet it seems to manipulate shadows and the light
		Line4: around it to its own advantage in order to attack and consume its prey.
		Line5: Its gigantic visage, as well as its ability to seemlingly melt back into the shadow
		Line6: of the howling blizzards of the tundra, leads me to believe it may as well be an
		Line7: interloper from another realm. As of where it comes from, it yet illudes me.
		Line8: Even Draedon's logs couldn't make heads or tails of this beast.
	}

	LunaticCultist: {
		Line1: The gifted one that terminated my grand summoning so long ago with his uncanny powers over the arcane.
		Line2: Someone I once held in such contempt for his actions is now...deceased, his sealing ritual undone...
		Line3: Prepare for the end.
		Line4: Your impending doom approaches...
	}

	MoonLord: {
		Line1: What you killed was the crippled self of an ancient terror. This cosmic titan invaded Terraria in the
		Line2: late Draconic Era with its abominable army, causing death and destruction on a scale previously undreamt of.
		Line3: The Surface dwellers called it Fovos, Unyielding Dread, for few could bear its towering presence.
	}

	TorchGod: {
		Line1: Theres a torch god???
		Line2: That would imply the existance of a torch dragon...
		Line3: ...
		Line4: I must study this further...
	}

	GoblinArmy: {
		Line1: The Goblin Armies... While they do not pose any threat to my power at all, they can still be a
		Line2: nuisance to my subjects. They are quite resilient when it comes to strength and numbers.
		Line3: I do find it quite a hassle to deal with them because they can cause so much destruction.
		Line4: They have attacked my kingdom quite a few times, but they are no challenge to me whatsoever.
	}

	Pirates: {
		Line1: Pirates are just that, pirates, most likely escapees of the evil regime that tore through terraria.
		Line2: Originally nomads, bound to water, they soon were driven from there too as the waters took on a sickly green
		Line3: and the scent of death. Now airbourne raiders, they seek out bases, points of activity, be it rebels or imperial,
		Line4: and pillage what they can just to survive.
	}

	TheHallow: {
		Line1: It is the essence of the god of light, not from a corpse but rather infused into the wall of flesh by his own hand.
		Line2: Many are fooled by its appearance and assume it is something holy, but it truly is a threat to everything on this
		Line3: world, as it too is also a form of corruption.
	}

	TheJungle: {
		Line1: The strength of nature is strongly shown in the jungle, fierce creatures and intelligent beings live within the
		Line2: ground below, an inspiring area indeed.
		Line3: The jungle is definitely one of my favorite places to visit, and it seems as though draedon had an interest in
		Line4: it as well... if only I had know what he was working on down there...
	}

	GreatSandShark: {
		Line1: Once, it was a fierce hunter, preying upon creatures across the desert. However, the intense heat combined with
		Line2: the violent sandstorms of the desert wore down its constitution.
		Line3: Over time, it adapted to burrow into the sand to rest after feeding.
		Line4: It is believed that it continues to feed as it rests under the sand, but nobody who has seen it do so has returned
		Line5: to spread the truth.
	}

	Sandstorm: {
		Line1: As with the world's heat, the sandstorms were amplified by the ancient deities' actions.
		Line2: The vast desert was already quite inhospitable due to its blazing heat.
		Line3: A slight increase in wind and sand was all that was needed to make one of the most inhospitable places even moreso.
	}

	Eclipse: {
		Line1: Monsters of the Eclipse have never really been fully understood.
		Line2: Many different cultures and species have speculated that their appearance is a result of the sun being eaten.
		Line3: Regardless, the creatures of the Eclipse are quite dangerous.
		Line4: Some people theorize that these creatures are the products of a deity's power escaping and manifesting into
		Line5: creatures of destruction.
	}

	PumpkinMoon: {
		Line1: In ages past, this event would mark the end of a harvest season. Now, it marks the end of any chance of survival
		Line2: one may have had.
		Line3: The Pumpking is a particularly interesting figure. I have never truly considered what this creature may have
		Line4: once been. Whatever it be, however, it is beyond saving now.
	}

	FrostMoon: {
		Line1: As the season is young, the cold is gentle, yet it will quickly become merciless and unforgiving.
		Line2: This chilling atmosphere is the result of ancient entities of unknown origin.
		Line3: Of course, as it has been ages since such creatures came into being, their intentions remain unclear.
		Line4: This particular frost moon holds a further oddity, an Ice Queen.
		Line5: Supposedly a beautiful and elegant woman, but rather cold and mysterious...
	}

	TheOldOnesArmy: {
		Line1: There was once a mighty civilisation that dominated ancient Terraria.
		Line2: This long-forgotten civilization was powerful and knowledgeable. They harnessed arcane forces and created marvels.
		Line3: Their most advanced creations, in particular, are the most perplexing.
		Line4: It is said that their old dragon, Betsy, is no mere beast, but a weapon of war forged by their ancient magic.
		Line5: The old ones are long gone, but vestiges of their legacy remain.
		Line6: Betsy being the oldest and most prominent one, but she is no auric dragon...
	}

	Towers: {
		Line1: If the cultists were to fall, there was a safeguard in place, four towers connected to celestial moons that would
		Line2: hold the seal together to prevent the return of Fovos. However the towers magic transports the inhabitants of said
		Line3: moons here to defend them...
	}

	SolarTower: {
		Line1: The Solar Moon is home to a moon scorched by the sun, these beings harness its power to create weapons and pride
		Line2: themselves on their melee prowess.
	}

	VortexTower: {
		Line1: The Vortex Moon is in an area of instability, the chaotic energy regularly opens rifts on the moon, the inhabitants
		Line2: comprise of deadly alien hornets and the people who created the firepower to exterminate them.
	}

	NebulaTower: {
		Line1: The Nebula Moon is in a cosmic dust cloud, illuminated with a large amount of mana. The creatures of this moon have
		Line2: superior intellect and like absorbing the intellect of others.
	}

	StardustTower: {
		Line1: The Stardust Moon out of reach of the sun's light, instead chemical reactions within the core create an eerie blue
		Line2: glow. The creatures of this moon are coated in this light, which when refined, turns into a mythical gold.
	}

	AcidRain: {
		Line1: The pollution of the sulphur sea takes to the skies, as the rain adopts its corrosive and caustic properties.
		Line2: during these terrifying torrents the most evolved of creatures show themselves.
		Line3: Proving once more that nature always finds a way.
	}

	TheGrandThunderBird: {
		Line1: There was a magnificent and powerful bird that ruled the skies above these lands. It waged war on me
		Line2: and my army, yet we managed to defeat it. However, I still wonder if the Grand Thunder Bird is actually
		Line3: dead. I have not heard of him again after that battle, and this gives me a feeling of unease.
	}

	QueenJellyfish: {
		Line1: The Queen Jellyfish used to rule the ocean, and its minions would do its bidding.
		Line2: This jellyfish is extremely powerful, but it has not been seen for a while.
		Line3: Some say that it's gone extinct, but the Cultists I have taken into my custody have
		Line4: told me many times that it's still roaming, swallowing up unfortunate divers who swim
		Line5: too close.
	}

	Viscount: {
		Line1: A very powerful creature who had to be sealed deep underground, and now he serves to
		Line2: protect whatever he can get his grasp on. He is a strong vampire, and can use his strong
		Line3: voice to inflict extreme pain, as well as turning the victims around him into bats.
		Line4: However, he seems to be weakened by sunlight, which can limit his powers.
	}

	BuriedChampion: {
		Line1: A brave fighter who once served under the Ancient Spirits of Light and Dark. He fought all
		Line2: sorts of enemies and became legendary for his heroic deeds. Unfortunately, he died in battle,
		Line3: but a few thousand years later, something reanimated him. He now attacks anything he senses,
		Line4: but he is weaker than he was in his former life.
	}

	GraniteEnergyStorm: {
		Line1: It is said that it is so destructive, that it will destroy anything that comes into contact
		Line2: with it, and the spirits themselves were afraid of it. However, I have discovered that if
		Line3: the storm is weakened, it can be captured in a bottle, allowing me to take its destructive
		Line4: power for myself.
	}

	StarScouter: {
		Line1: It wasn't uncommon to have extraterrestrials try and invade the planet, as their worlds were
		Line2: slowly being wiped out by a sinister infection, Time and time again more saucers would come
		Line3: by, only for me to blow them out of the sky.
	}

	ThePrimordials: {
		Line1: The Primordials... Powerful entities that can control the elements of fire, water, and earth,
		Line2: they are some of the few entities that I have not been able to defeat. Even now that I am this
		Line3: powerful, they still have strength that is very dangerous to me. These beings are one of the
		Line4: only things aside from Xeroc that can pose a genuine threat to my power.
	}

	TheLich: {
		Line1: The Lich... I heard that he has reawakened and is seeking souls to feed his power again, but it is
		Line2: of no concern. The Lich is very powerful against humans, but it has no match against me in terms
		Line3: of strength and willpower. I have already killed him once before, and I am certain I can do it again.
	}

	CoznixTheFallenBeholder: {
		Line1: The Beholders are an annoying species... They can shoot lasers, probe minds, and they also are
		Line2: very strong in phychic combat. However, I eventually did defeat Coznix, and its corpse now serves
		Line3: as a trophy above my throne. Coznix was quite an impressive specimen, it is a shame that it had
		Line4: to be destroyed, but I must rule above all else.
	}

	BoreanStrider: {
		Line1: The powerful Borean Strider was an annoyance in the blizzards of the frigid tundra. It took
		Line2: some time to hunt down and slay, as it was a very large and powerful creature. Its speed and
		Line3: strength make it a great contender against my forces, as well as its children that were hiding
		Line4: inside it's icy abdomen.
	}

	AbyssionTheForgottenOne: {
		Line1: Its appearance is quite ominous and very threatening, so I would be worried if I had not already
		Line2: become as powerful as I am now. I know very little about the forgotten one, but I know that it
		Line3: will not be a threat to my rule.
	}

	AquaticDepths: {
		Line1: Similar to the sunken sea, however not as deep as the abyss, the aquatic depths certainly don't
		Line2: hold as terrifying of creatures as the ones deep in the abyss, but it is still very dangerous.
		Line3: The explorers I've sent down there always come back rambling on about hallucinations.
	}

	PatchWerk: {
		Line1: The undead come in all sorts of amalgamations, stitched together corpses however are extremely
		Line2: rare. Someone advanced in the art of necromancy would have to have a hand in their creation.
		Line3: Perhaps the strange object in the graveyard could explain its origin later on...
	}

	CorpseBloom: {
		Line1: A small predatory mutant bulb, apparently created by feeding the jungle plants souls
		Line2: This one is small and imperfect, I bet the perfected one Is much larger...
	}

	Illusionist: {
		Line1: Many powerful prisoners were thrown into the dungeon, some with powerful magics and
		Line2: devious tricks up their sleeves. After some time their skeletons reanimated and while
		Line3: their minds are gone, their skills still remain.
	}

	TheOcean: {
		Line1: Take care to not disturb the deep waters of this world.
		Line2: You may awaken something more terrifying than death itself.
	}

	Granite: {
		Line1: A dark chasm of ominous blue stone, I felt a strange energy in the air as I explored further, as if the cave
		Line2: itself was electrified.
		Line3: Constructs made from the walls itself emerge to protect this strange cave...
	}

	Marble: {
		Line1: A beautiful white chasm where ancient warriors of the past were buried, as well as pottery from civilizations
		Line2: long ago. These buried champions rise up to protect their tomb when disturbed.
	}

	Blizzard: {
		Line1: Whenever there is rain the snow in the tundra becomes harsher, and the frozen constructs hidden deep
		Line2: in the snow animate.
		Line3: With reduced visibility and Permafrost's ice golems on the lose, its dangerous to venture unprepared.
	}

	TheVagrantOfSpaceAndTime: {
		Line1: A hooded figure who seems to be a starfarer himself, I know hes been trying to
		Line2: catch me for the longest time. However he shall not succeed, no matter how many
		Line3: mortals he tests.
	}

	ThespianTheActOfAlchemy: {
		Line1: An odd concoction was given to me by a servent of mine, he promised it would
		Line2: bring me great strength in battle, little did I know it was the catalyst of
		Line3: reviving a long dead alchemist. I felt myself being controlled and mocked by
		Line4: the large mask above him, but I was able to overcome it's control and defeat
		Line5: the phantom.
	}

	DioskouroiTheTwinForces: {
		Line1: An eternal feud between two siblings, endangering all who they come across.
		Line2: Not listening to anyone else or any reason but to best the other in their
		Line3: endless battle. I do wonder what caused them to hate eachother so much.
	}

	Corvus: {
		Line1: A cold, abandoned planet that used to be a prosperous society before the Ardor.
		Line2: As resources became scarce the planet became war torn and desolate, eventually
		Line3: its inhabitants left the planet, making it an easy target for space pirates.
	}

	Caelum: {
		Line1: Caelum... a planet splitting in twain, the decay runs so deep the planet may not
		Line2: survive much longer, the mana concentration however is incredible, keeping the
		Line3: souls of its inhabitants as apparitions, who have long forgotten themselves.
	}

	Cygnus: {
		Line1: A curious cluster of asteroids, perhaps the remnants of a planet... there are signs of
		Line2: civilization in some of these rocks, yet I can't quite put the pieces together...
	}

	Aries: {
		Line1: Its disgusting what happened to this planet... it could have been teeming with live before, but people got too
		Line2: greedy and mined out the core of the world, now it is a broken husk of what it once was...
	}

	Celestia: {
		Line1: These structures are quite beautiful and give off a hefty amount of mana for being in the
		Line2: middle of nowhere... Must of been a worship site of some sort...
	}

	Serpens: {
		Line1: Most starfarers believe this to be a foreign mass, a dead leviathan class organism...
		Line2: But on further inspection this is the corpse of a god.
		Line3: It wreaks of pestilence as the corpse corrupts itself and leaks onto the nearby planet.
		Line4: Whoever is killing these gods is causing serious catastrophes to unfold...
	}

	Scorpius: {
		Line1: The moon responsible for the blood moon occurances is also haboring the corpse of a slain god, whoever did this
		Line2: has been doing really sloppy work, as the crimson had leaked onto the neighboring planet as well.
		Line3: Whoever this Yharim is, he needs to be stopped.
	}

	PenthesileaTheWitchOfInk: {
		Line1: A powerful witch who uncovered the magic of art� In a literal sense. Able to channel an immense amount of mana
		Line2: into paints and pigments, she was able to weaponize her artistic ability and become a terrifying master of the
		Line3: artistic arcane.
	}

	UltraPlant: {
		Line1: This construct seems a little out of place, Constantly generating electricity, and it looks like the trees are
		Line2: alive and made of wires. This place seems to be rarely visited by two cosmic beings from another universe...
	}

	Tucana: {
		Line1: This planet is at the inner edge of the habitable zone of this star... the whole planet is lush and hostile.
		Line2: Its amazing how the same life ended up on the jungles of the neighboring planet...
	}

	FallenTheranhad: {
		Line1: This used to be a majestic land, a floating archipelago with beautiful architecture, till the emperor of the
		Line2: land was drawn to an entropic god's will... and the place fell apart in a cosmic plague.
	}

	FaintArchives: {
		Line1: This is another place that is shrouded in mystery, It seems to be a temple of sorts but its ambiguous where
		Line2: it's origin lies, however it contains so many secrets. Who knows? maybe the solution to the ardor lies here.
	}

	AstralPlague: {
		Line1: After folling the trail of the plague that destroyed Theranhad, I found that it had significantly evolved overtime.
		Line2: Twisting weak minded creatures to its will, and now traveling by meteor to other planets.
		Line3: First the Ardor and now this... what more will torment this galaxy?
	}

	NalhaunTheBurnishedKing: {
		Line1: A ruler who lost his mind, with his weapon he ruled his world with an iron fist, however it was one of the first
		Line2: worlds to fall to the ardor, the king survived out of pure rage and madness, his sword granting him the power of
		Line3: a starbarer.
	}

	AsphodeneAndEridani: {
		Line1: These two, they're starting to annoy me, They wouldn't understand what I have to do to save this
		Line2: galaxy. And their champion? They need to focus on the conflicts of their own planet.
		Line3: soon they will find me, and I'll have no choice but to eliminate them.
	}

	ObservatoryHyperborea: {
		Line1: One of many floating satelites that can be found orbiting habitable worlds. It's unclear who built
		Line2: them or what their purpose was, but they could make for a good base of operations if one were to
		Line3: restore them.
	}

	TheMartians: {
		Line1: The long lost inhabitants of Aries, the Martians mined out their planet a long time ago till the
		Line2: core was broken through, in search of a new place to live, they would rather take over and wipe out
		Line3: the life on other planets than resort to diplomacy...
	}

	DreamingCity: {
		Line1: A mysterious city that seems out of place, almost like its from another dimension. When I visited this
		Line2: city I was awestruck from the exotic architecture... thats when it happened, dark creatures appeared out
		Line3: of nowhere and drove me away... and the city vanished as I left...
	}

	Lyra: {
		Line1: Anomaly Iota... the planet is mostly acidic and definitely unsafe to be on for too long, It seems to have
		Line2: frequent earthquakes, however they are to a rhythm, almost like a heartbeat...
	}

	Arbitration: {
		Line1: Once again I sought out the Dreaming City, I fought through the many nightmarish creatures that roamed there.
		Line2: But then I was transported to another place, one that had yet to be charted on the stellaglyph...
		Line3: I saw a being so frightening... so powerful, No doubt it would be a danger to us all...
		Line4: I had to flee, to escape this place, theres no doubt that arbitration would have killed me on sight.
	}

	WarriorOfLight: {
		Line1: How reckless can they be? To break the seal on such a dangerous god such as Fovos. They may have won but they
		Line2: are becoming to dangerous to be allowed to live.
		Line3: I shall send my strongest warrior there at once, to bring them to their knees.
		Line4: Once those pests are done, we shall take out Yharim ourselves...
	}

	Tsukiyomi: {
		Line1: In this vast universe, there are myriad beings who possess the strength to challenge me.
		Line2: Tsukiyomi claims to be one of them. Whether her claims are grounded in fact or are merely the delusions of a fanatic
		Line3: remain to be seen. Either way, it will amount to the same thing in the end.
	}

	TrojanSquirrel: {
		Line1: After Draedon's introduction to my army, many saw the fruits of engineering and the might of which appeared.
		Line2: Even the lowest creatures of Terraria wanted to create mechanics of large and imposing stature.
		Line3: However, none can compare to the Nightmare Fabricator and his mind.
		Line4: This puny machine is simply an insult to his great works; it could hardly even be considered as an opponent.
	}

	Lepus: {
		Line1: Every year on a certain sunday a weird disease plagues the bunnies of the lands.
		Line2: Not a result of the crimson or corruption, but something not even my top scientists can figure out what this plague is...
		Line3: All we know is that theres a bigger bunny somewhere, hatching these disgusting amalgamations...
	}

	Turkor: {
		Line1: Once to celebrate our many great victories, My royal cooks prepared for us a feast.
		Line2: Little did they know the stuffing was tainted with a dark magic, the roasted fowl grew 10 sizes and regrew its heads.
		Line3: And in that moment what was going to be a healthy feast would turn into such a disaster...
	}

	Deviantt: {
		Line1: A deformed figure and great power like no other, one would first assume they are deities themselves.
		Line2: However this notion is false, their strength comes from the essences of Gods that they have absorbed.
		Line3: I had once asked them to join my legion, but they had refused, stating that they will not be a servant to anyone.
		Line4: Such a commendable trait, even if it did not work in my favour.
	}

	TheTerminator: {
		Line1: The brightest and most intelligent subjects were given new life in this machine.
		Line2: Acting as a central intelligence, this machine was stealthy, gathering as much intel as it can before silencing the enemy.
		Line3: Draedon used much of the terminator's data to make improvements to his machines.
		Line4: It was one of his most useful assets.
	}

	TheCaretaker: {
		Line1: Draedon always had a fascination with the bees in the jungle...
		Line2: One of his machines was made to replicate a queen bee, trying to copy and mimic the behavior of the mutant species.
		Line3: It served as a perfect war machine, being able to take out many who opposed us.
		Line4: I viewed it as a success but for Draedon it wasn't good enough.
	}

	Stasys: {
		Line1: Based on the strange creature found in the tundra blizzards,
		Line2: Draedon created a huge freightloader with extraordinary strength.
		Line3: Outfitted with experimental weaponry, it was known as a terrifying mechanical beast...
		Line4: In reality however, it was the least effective of the mechs.
	}

	SiegeEngine: {
		Line1: After observing the Wall of Flesh, Draedon began construction and a mechanical replica.
		Line2: This machine would be used to subdue the wall if it were ever to start rampaging through the underworld.
		Line3: It also would act as a new prison to contain the energy of the fallen gods...
		Line4: The wrathful machine used plans from an ancient bronze structure,
		Line5: Which was said to be a replacement furnace if hell were ever to freeze over.
	}

	BanishedBaron: {
		Line1: One of the first machines I had Draedon construct, made to resemble a fishron
		Line2: Unfortunately it was the most disobedient, all attempts to tame it were futile...
		Line3: The extreme weaponry made it an especially dangerous threat, We were lucky that it swam off to sea.
		Line4: This failure lead to Draedon being more selective in the souls he used for his later machines.
	}

	Lifelight: {
		Line1: The proclaimed master of pixies, perhaps even the conciousness of a slain diety manifested into a polterghastly visage.
		Line2: It appears as a sphere of golden artifacts, sometimes even condensed into a golden pyramid.
		Line3: Not much is known about this construct of gold.
		Line4: But it's screeching cries are enough to send chills down someones spine.
	}

	Ocram: {
		Line1: An old wulfram machine abandoned in the corruption, slowly became infected and taken over by the hive mind.
		Line2: His rage is pure, in fact its the only thing that goes through this machination's foul mind.
		Line3: It plans to take it's revenge on you now in this improved form.
		Line4: You must slay this creature once and for all...
	}

	SerialDesignationN: {
		Line1: A worker drone corrupted by an extremely advanced, eldritch intelligence of unknown origin
		Line2: It seeks to consume all life to satiate its hunger.
		Line3: Creating singularities that destroy entire planets.
		Line4: Thes Corrupted drones evolved into vimpiric machines that were unleashed upon humanity.
	}

	Exodygen: {
		Line1: A God that takes a slime like appearance. Not much is known about this divine entity.
		Line2: Different than the abomination called Goozma, This slime seems to gain its power from
		Line3: the remnants of Draedon's ultimate machines...
	}

	CursedMirror: {
		Line1: An odd trinket that seems to create a hostile reflection of ones self, holding a legendary blade
		Line2: A tough trial indeed, However you seem to have ascended past yourself
		Line3: Maybe the reflection in the mirror is there to show exactly how far you've come...
	}

	Polyphemalus: {
		Line1: I do not know the origin of this being, however each eye seems to bear the powers
		Line2: of what was used to seal Fovos away... perhaps this entity is connected in some way.
		Line3: Either way its best to exterminate it.
	}
